# PIICrunch API
PIICrunch is an application designed to redact sensitive information from government-issued documents like Aadhar cards, passports, voter IDs, driving licenses, and social security cards. It automatically identifies and removes personally identifiable information (PII), such as names, addresses, and IDs. Users can customize the redaction process to target specific information. The tool operates on an Encrypt-Transfer-Store (ETS) model, ensuring no files are stored after processing. PIICrunch prioritizes privacy and security, providing a safe way to handle sensitive documents.
